# Exercism Code Challenges

Welcome to my Exercism Solutions Repository 🎯This repo contains my solutions to coding challenges from Exercism. Each exercise is organized by track and language, with a focus on clarity, maintainability, and learning progression.

## 📂 Repository Structure

```

 - Language folders → Grouped by track (C#, Python, etc.)
 - Exercise folders → Contain solution code + notes
 - README.md per exercise → Short explanation, approach, and test results

## 🚀 Goals

 - Strengthen problem-solving skills through progressive challenges
 - Practice clean, modular code design
 - Document approaches, trade-offs, and lessons learned
 - Build a reference library of idiomatic solutions across multiple languages

## 👮️ Tech & Tools

 - Languages: C#, Python, and more as I expand
 - Testing: Exercism’s built-in test suites
 - Documentation: Markdown notes for clarity and reflection

## 📖 How to Use

Clone the repo:
`git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/exercism.git`

Navigate to a track:
`cd exercism/python/leap`

Run tests (example for Python):
`pytest`

Or for C#:
`dotnet test`

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

I approach each challenge with:
- First principles → Solve simply, then refine
Iteration → Start with a working solution, then optimize
Documentation → Capture reasoning, not just code

## 📌 Next Steps

 - Expand coverage across more tracks
 - Add visual diagrams for selected solutions (Mermaid/ASCII trees)
 - Automate progress tracking with a script

## 🤝 Contributing

This repo is primarily for my personal learning journey, but feedback and suggestions are always welcome. If you spot improvements, feel free to open an issue or PR.
